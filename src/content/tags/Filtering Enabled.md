[Filtering Enabled](https://github.com/eunhalua/tags/blob/main/Filtering%20Enabled.md) is a feature that prevents changes made on the client side to replicate to the server side. This was previously an optional feature put in place by Roblox to combat exploiters but is now forced onto all experiences and cannot be toggled following Roblox's strict imposement of anti-exploits.
