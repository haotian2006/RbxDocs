Remote Functions allow you to send and receive data from either side in a two-way manner. Unlike Remote Events, Remote Functions will wait until the function is done running or returns something.

**NOTE:** Any changes done by the client will not appear on the server, unless it's network-owned by the Player. See [FilteringEnabled](https://github.com/eunhalua/tags/blob/main/FilteringEnabled.md).
